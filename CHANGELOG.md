# Changelog

Patch notes for Google Play Store releases. Newest first.

## Backend (no client update required)

- Fixed a privacy bug where custom exercises created by one user could show up in other users' exercise lists.
- Fixed several account-security gaps where a user could potentially view or modify another user's workouts, scheduled workouts, or workout plans.
- Fixed a bug where trying to update someone else's weight entry returned a server error instead of being cleanly blocked.
- Fixed a bug where generating a trainer invite code could fail with a server error.
- The "forgot password" flow no longer fails if the confirmation email can't be sent — you'll still get a clean response either way.
- Added stricter validation on workout, meal, and profile data submitted to the server (realistic ranges for reps, weight, calories, macros, etc.).
- Fixed the "forgot password" email failing intermittently — the CI deploy workflow was overwriting the Gmail API credentials on every push to `main` because `gcloud run deploy --set-env-vars` replaces the whole env var set rather than merging. Gmail credentials are now passed through CI as secrets so they survive every deploy.

## 1.0.2+6

- Redesigned the Premium upgrade screen and added a free trial option.

## 1.0.2+5

### Fixed

- Your login session is now stored more securely on your device.
- Removed debug logging that could include sensitive account details.
- Added clearer validation messages when registering or updating your profile (required fields, email format, minimum password length, minimum age).

## 1.0.2+4


- Fixed a bug where users could get randomly logged out, even with a valid session. Sessions now renew automatically in the background instead of requiring a full re-login.

## 1.0.2+3


- Fixed a bug where removing an exercise from a workout during editing wasn't actually saved — the deleted exercise would come back.

### Improved

- The workout-complete checkmark now uses a distinct success green instead of the neutral dark color, making it clearer when a workout is finished.
